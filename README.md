### this Github consist of all the code and output produced for Network Science Project  


Each question folder corresponds to the ipynb and python files used and the output produced using the code.  

Crawling, Q1, Q4:  
- ipynb has exactly the same code as the py file, with ipynb showing the output for each step



Q2,Q3:
- files for creating graph only has .py version and does not have ipynb
- Q2Q3.ipynb utilises the result generated from creatingGraph.py and creatingRandomGraph.py
- Q2Q3.py contains the same code as Q2Q3



main.py consist of all the code, including crawling, Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4.  
- it is recommended to run the py/ipynb file question by question due to the long time and gpu resources required.
