Output/output graph folder:  
- this folder consist of all the output graph used for analysis.
- the graph generated are classified according to the question  


Crawling, Q1, Q4:  
- ipynb has exactly the same code as the py file, with ipynb showing the output for each step



Q2,Q3:
- files for creating graph only has .py version and does not have ipynb
- Q2Q3.ipynb utilises the result generated from creatingGraph.py and creatingRandomGraph.py
- Q2Q3.py contains the same code as Q2Q3



main.py consist of all the code, including crawling, Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4.  
- it is recommended to run the py/ipynb file question by question due to the long time and gpu resources required.
